			<h2>Summary</h2>
			Inception (2010), directed by Christopher Nolan, is a science fiction thriller centered around Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in stealing secrets from people's subconscious during dreams. Cobb is offered a chance to have his criminal record erased if he can achieve "inception"—the act of planting an idea in someone's mind without them realizing it. He assembles a team to implant the idea into the mind of a corporate heir, Robert Fischer, by navigating through layered dream worlds. As the mission progresses, Cobb struggles with his own subconscious, haunted by memories of his late wife Mal, threatening the team's success and his grip on reality.
